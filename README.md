# TRACE

A full-stack cybersecurity tool built with FastAPI (backend) and SvelteKit (frontend).

## Project Overview

**TRACE** (Targeted Reconnaissance for Advanced Content Exploitation) is a cybersecurity analysis tool designed to streamline penetration testing for analysts. It integrates multiple tools into a single dashboard, allowing users to scan networks, execute brute-force attacks, detect vulnerabilities, and visualize systems via tree graphs. The system is built for analysts at the Data Analysis Centerâ€™s Cyber Experimentation & Analysis Division (DAC CEAD).
